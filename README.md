# Dependency Inversion Principle
This application was developed to demonstrate the Dependency Inversion Principle, ensuring a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.
It is designed as a notification system that is capable to send notification from various channels (such as email and SMS).

## Getting Started

# Compiling the Application
To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript, run the following command:

`npm run build`

# Starting the Application
To start the application, run the following command:

`npm start`

# Usage
To test the application and see the results in the console, you should modify the `app.ts` file, following the two examples that are already there, in order to send a new notification. 

After modifying the objects or creating a new one, the application should be compiled and started once again.
